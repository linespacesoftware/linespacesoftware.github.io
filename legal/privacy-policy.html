                            In this Policy (as defined below), unless the context requires otherwise, the following
                            capitalized

                            "<strong>Active Processing</strong>" means instances where Linespace has directly been
                            provided with the
                            Personal Information/Personal Data of Data Subjects, such as when Data Subjects submit an
                            enquiry in respect of our Services or when Data Subjects provide Personal
                            Information/Personal
                            Data to Linespace pursuant to concluding any commercial agreement(s) with Linespace.<br />

                            Passive Processing Means to collect Information from Data Subjects. These Passive Processing
                            Means allow Linespace to Process certain kinds of Non-personally Identifiable Information
                            which can perhaps not be linked to Data Subjects.<br />
                            <br />

                            without the use of additional Information, provided that such additional Information is kept
                            separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the
                            Personal Information/Personal Data is not attributed to Data Subjects.<br />
                            <br />

                            analysis, retinal scanning and voice recognition.<br />

                            Data Subjects, either temporarily in connection with a Data Subjects Internet Protocol (IP)
                            address (known as a temporary or session cookie, or deleted once a Data Subject closes their
                            browser window) or more permanently on the hard drive of a Data Subject's device (known as a
                            permanent or persistent cookie). Linespace Website(s) or Mobile Application(s) may, from
                            time
                            to time, use session cookies so that Data subjects do not have to fill in the same
                            Information
                            from page to page within our Website(s) or Mobile Application(s). If Data Subject elects not

                            agreement with Linespace in terms of which such Customer procures the Products or Services

                            Data Subject's interactions with the relevant Website(s) or Mobile Application(s). It is
                            temporarily downloaded onto a Data Subject's device from our web server or a Third-Party
                            Operator. This program is active only while a Data Subject is connected to the relevant

                            <br />

                            <br />

                            Information/Personal Data and face-to-face personal engagements with Data Subjects.<br />
                            <br />
                            "<strong>GDPR</strong>" means the General Data Protection Regulation, which is a European
                            law that governs

                            Union.<br />
                            <br />

                            whether in web-based
                            format or device-native format, to which this Privacy Policy relates and through which
                            Customer(s) and Third-Parties gain access to Linespace's Products and/or Services.<br />
                            <br />
                            "<strong>Mobile Device Identifier</strong>" means device information if you access our
                            Website(s) or Mobile
                            Application(s) through mobile devices. Certain features of the relevant Website(s) or Mobile
                            Application(s) may require the collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that
                            phone number with the mobile device identifiers. Additionally, some mobile phone service
                            providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their
                            service.
                            Depending on the provider, Linespace and/or our Third-Party Operators may receive this
                            Information. If Linespace associates any such passively-collected information with the

                        contractual obligations in respect of Data Subjects and Third Parties in general.<br />
                        <br />

                        Linespace places a high premium on the privacy of every person or organization with whom it
                        interacts or engages and therefore acknowledges the need to ensure that Personal
                        Information/Personal Data is handled with a reasonable standard of care as may be expected
                        from it. Linespace is therefore committed to ensuring that it complies with the requirements
                        of
                        POPIA and also with the terms of the GDPR to the extent that the GDPR applies.<br />
                        <br />

                        When a Data Subject or Third Party engages with Linespace, whether it be physically or via
                        any
                        digital or electronic interfaces such as Linespace’s Website, the Data Subject or Third
                        Party
                        acknowledges that they trust Linespace to Process their Personal Information/Personal Data,
                        including the Personal Information/Personal Data of their dependents, beneficiaries,
                        customers,
                        members, or employees as the case may be, which further entrenches the importance of
                        Linespace’s compliance with Applicable Laws in regards to the Processing of Personal
                        Information/Personal Data.<br />
                        <br />

                        All Data Subjects and Third-Parties have the right to object to the Processing of their
                        Personal
                        Information/Personal Data. It should be voluntary to accept the Terms and Conditions to
                        which this Policy relates to. However, Linespace does require the Data Subject or Third
                        Party's
                        acceptance to enable the proper use of Linespace's Website and/or Services.<br />
                        <br />

                        <strong>PURPOSE AND APPLICATION</strong><br />
                        The purposes of this Policy are not only to inform Data Subjects of what Personal
                        Information/Personal Data of theirs Linespace may Process, where Linespace may have
                        collected such Personal Information/Personal Data from (if not directly from them as the
                        Data Subject), how Linespace Processes their Personal Information/Personal Data, but also to
                        establish a standard by which Linespace and its employees, representatives and operators
                        shall comply in as far as the Processing of Personal Information/Personal Data is
                        concerned.<br />
                        <br />

                        Linespace, in its capacity as a Responsible Party and/or Operator and/or Controller, as the
                        case
                        may be, shall strive to observe and comply with its obligations under POPIA and the GDPR (as
                        may be applicable and to the extent necessary) when it Processes Personal
                        Information/Personal Data from or in respect of any Data Subject.<br />
                        <br />

                        <strong>COLLECTING AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION/PERSONAL DATA</strong><br />

                        Whenever any Data Subject engages with Linespace, whether it be physically or electronically
                        or through the use of its Services, facilities, or Website Linespace will, in effect, be
                        Processing
                        the Data Subject's Personal Information/Personal Data.<br />
                        <br />

                        It may be from time to time that Linespace has collected a Data Subject's Personal
                        Information/Personal Data from other sources, and in such instances, Linespace will inform
                        the Data Subject by virtue of any privacy notices it deploys from time to time. In the event
                        that a Data Subject has shared their Personal Information/Personal Data with any third
                        parties, Linespace will not be responsible for any loss suffered by the Data Subject, their
                        dependents, beneficiaries, customers, representatives, agents or employees (as the case
                        may be).<br />
                        <br />

                        When a Data Subject provides Linespace with the Personal Information of any other Third
                        Party, Linespace will process the Personal Information/Personal Data of such Third Party in
                        line with this Policy, as well as any terms and conditions or privacy notices to which this
                        Policy
                        Relates. <br />
                        <br />

                        Linespace will primarily Process Personal Information/Personal Data in order to facilitate
                        and
                        enhance the delivery of Products and/or Services to its Customers, manage and administer its
                        business, foster a legally compliant workplace environment, as well as safeguard the
                        Personal
                        Information/Personal Data relating to any Data Subjects which it in fact holds. In such an
                        instance, the Data Subject providing Linespace with such Personal Information/Personal Data
                        may also be required to confirm that they are a Competent Person and have the authority to
                        give the requisite consent to enable Linespace to process such Personal Information/Personal
                        Data.<br />
                        <br />

                        Linespace undertakes to process any Personal Information/Personal Data in a manner that
                        promotes the constitutional right to privacy and retains accountability and Data Subject
                        participation.<br />
                        <br />

                        Prior to recording the purpose(s) for which Linespace may, or will, process the Personal
                        Information/Personal Data of Data Subjects, Linespace hereby records the types of Personal
                        Information/Personal Data of Data Subjects it may process from time to time:

                        Subjects from time to time pursuant to any engagement with them, Linespace may process

                        by Law or in order to fulfill a legitimate business purpose of Linespace, and the Data
                        Subject fails to provide such Personal Information/Personal Data, Linespace may, on notice
                        to the Data

                        <br />

                        In further compliance with Applicable Laws, Linespace will take steps to notify the relevant
                        Regulator(s) and/or any affected Data Subjects in the event of a security breach and will
